We are using Jenni's data from her Master's thesis on fish from the Saint John River. The data file is called New_Brunswick_Fall_2020_fish_data.csv and attached to this repo. For this study, two fish species (Smallmouth Bass and Yellow Perch) were caught at each of three location relative to the Mactaquac Dam: one upstream and two downstream. Fish were sexed, weighed and measured and their muscle tissue was collected for future analysis. Once in the lab, the fish were analyzed for mercury concentration. 

## JD: This seems too broad
For this project, Sally and Jenni plan to use statistics to explore any patterns of mercury concentration based on different variables including species, sex, length, weight and site. From here, we have the following hypotheses:

## JD: This sounds better
1. Mercury concentration will increase with fish length.
2. Mercury concentration will be higher in fish upstream from the dam than downstream because mercury methylation increases in flooded soils.
3. Mercury will be higher in Smallmouth Bass than Yellow Perch because Smallmouth Bass are positioned higher on the food web (we won't actually determine their position on the food web in this project but this is based off former studies in this system).
4. Variation in mercury concentration will best be explained by species, length, and site. 

JD: 2 could use a brief explanation; the explanation for 3 could frankly be shorter; 4 is not super clear: what is "best explained"?
